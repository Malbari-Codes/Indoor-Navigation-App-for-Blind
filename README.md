# Indoor-Navigation-App-for-Blind
### Overview

This app is created for a Final Year Project at FAST - National University for Computer and Emerging Sciences, Karachi. 
It detects traffic signs, placed indoors, and intructs blind/visually-impaired users to navigate through mobile audio. This is a camera app that continuously detects the traffic signs in the frames seen by your device's back camera, using a quantized [MobileNet SSD](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) model trained on the own dataset.
